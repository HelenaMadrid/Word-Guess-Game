# Word-Guess-Game
This is a Sailor Moon themed Word Guess Game I made for the third week of the coding bootcamp.

*Instructions*
The goal is to guess a specific word, in which case a song will be played and the image on the left will change.

To start the game: press any key to start the game.
Simply press a  letter on the keyboard and if that letter is part of the word, it will be shown in the placeholder, if not it will decrease the total guesses that the user has to correctly complete the word.
